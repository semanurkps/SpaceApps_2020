One of the best ways to reduce dependence on fossil fuels is to use green energy. Green energy obtained by using natural resources such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, plants, geothermal energy is also renewable energy sources. Solar energy systems have begun to be installed in residences in many European countries.

You can take a big step in reducing your carbon footprint by installing solar panels in homes or by moving to residential buildings that use solar energy. Choosing south facing homes and businesses offers great opportunities to reduce your carbon footprint. The sun should be used more for both illumination and warming. Decreasing the setting of the combi by 1 degree can reduce the annual carbon emission by 500 kg.
The best and most economical technology that can help us in this regard is Solar chimneys. (Solar chimneys: When the heat collected on the floor of a building is directed towards a high and narrow chimney, it drives the turbine installed in the chimney.)
